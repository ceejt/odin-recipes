        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <li><b>6</b> slices bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
            <li><b>1</b> link smoked pineapple-bacon chicken sausage, cut into slices</li>
            <li><b>1</b> tablespoon canola oil</li>
            <li><b>1</b> teaspoon butter</li>
            <li><b>2 and 1/2</b> cups frozen hash brown potatoes, thawed</li>
            <li><b>1/2</b> onion, chopped</li>
            <li><b>3/4</b> teaspoon garlic powder, divided</li>
            <li><b>1/2</b> teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li><b>1/4</b> teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li><b>1/4</b> teaspoon ground black pepper, or more to taste</li>
            <li><b>1</b> cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li><b>6</b> large eggs</li>
            <li><b>1</b> tablespoon milk</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>1.</b> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li><b>2.</b> Place bacon in a 10-inch skillet and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp, about 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove bacon to a paper towel-lined small bowl. Discard 1/2 of the bacon fat using a spoon.</li>
            <li><b>3.</b> Cook sausage in remaining bacon fat in the hot skillet until browned on both sides, about 5 minutes. Remove to the bowl with bacon.</li>
            <li><b>4.</b> Heat canola oil and butter in the same skillet over medium heat. Add hash browns and onion. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper. Spread hash brown mixture evenly in the skillet; cook, undisturbed, until browned, about 5 minutes. Turn hash browns over and sprinkle with Cheddar cheese.</li>
            <li><b>5.</b> Whisk together eggs, milk, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder in a medium bowl; season with salt and pepper. Pour egg mixture over cheese-covered hash browns in the skillet. Sprinkle the top with bacon and sausage pieces.</li>
            <li><b>6.</b> Bake in the preheated oven until the top is puffed, cheese is melted, and a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        </ul>
